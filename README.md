#Skillit: A skillshare-buddy finder app

![image](/static/search.png)

Skillit is designed to build community in an increasingly disconnected world by facilitating collaborative learning. If you want to take a hobby or skill to the next level, just enter your address, and Skillit shows you a real time map of other users within 2 km who are currently working and open to collaborating. Filter those users by what they're working on, and when you find someone who you'd like to meet up with, send them a message through the app telling them you're on your way - then head over to meet your new skill buddy!
